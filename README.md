# Messaging-App_L2-S2
Simple messaging app with simple interface made in Python on a group of 2

With Python, made a simple messaging app, with server and client connected connexion.
Also used threads for the first time, it feels really nice, when a part of program need constant execution of a specified task (like user input check)
But well, maybe that's one the main use for using threads I guess
